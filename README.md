Information We Collect:

User email: Goldfish Guard app can be used without registering your personal email address on the server.

This information will be stored on the server and used to login to servers and identify users' registered devices. Users can delete (unregister) their account from the servers at any time which will wipe all of their information including the email address.

Encrypted Login Data: To facilitate seamless synchronization between your registered devices, Goldfish Guard temporarily stores your encrypted login data for a limited time. This encrypted data is automatically deleted from our servers after the time limit has passed.

How We Use Your Information:

Temporary Data Storage: Your encrypted login data is temporarily stored to ensure smooth synchronization between your devices. Once the synchronization process is finished, your data is automatically removed from our servers.
